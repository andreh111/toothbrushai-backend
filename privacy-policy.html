            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>üîí Zero Data Collection Policy</h3>

            <h2>3. How Your Data Works in ToothBrush AI</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect your information, here's how the app works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your data is stored only on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Offline Operation:</strong> The app works completely offline</li>
                <li><strong>No Accounts:</strong> No registration or login required</li>
                <li><strong>No Subscriptions:</strong> No payment processing or recurring charges</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Your data never leaves your device</li>
                <li><strong>Data Control:</strong> You have complete control over your information</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you delete the app or reset your device, all your data will be permanently lost since it's stored locally only. We cannot recover your data because we don't have access to it.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>We do not share any information because we don't collect any information.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Since ToothBrush AI operates entirely offline and doesn't collect user data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We have no data to share with third parties</li>
                <li><strong>No Service Providers:</strong> We don't use analytics, cloud storage, or data processing services</li>
                <li><strong>No Legal Disclosures:</strong> We have no user data that could be subject to legal requests</li>
                <li><strong>No Business Transfers:</strong> There is no user data that could be transferred in business transactions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.1 App Store Distribution</h3>
            <p>The only data sharing occurs through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>App Store Downloads:</strong> Apple App Store and Google Play Store handle app distribution according to their own privacy policies</li>
                <li><strong>No User Data:</strong> These platforms do not receive any user data from our app</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted or stored on our servers, your data security depends on your device's security measures.</p>

            <h3>5.1 Local Device Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device-Level Protection:</strong> Your data is protected by your device's built-in security (device lock, biometrics, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>No Network Transmission:</strong> No data is sent over the internet, eliminating transmission risks</li>
                <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We don't have servers that could be compromised</li>
                <li><strong>App Sandboxing:</strong> The app operates within your device's security sandbox</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 Your Responsibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your device secure with appropriate locks and security measures</li>
                <li>Regularly back up your device if you want to preserve your data</li>
                <li>Be aware that uninstalling the app will delete all your data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect or store your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Server-Side Retention:</strong> We have no data retention policies because we don't retain any data</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Your data exists only on your device for as long as the app is installed</li>
                <li><strong>Permanent Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all your data</li>
                <li><strong>No Recovery:</strong> We cannot recover your data once it's deleted because we never had access to it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect your personal information, traditional data protection rights don't apply in the usual sense. However, you have complete control:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> You have full control over all your data at all times</li>
                <li><strong>No Access Requests Needed:</strong> All your data is already accessible to you within the app</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Deletion:</strong> Delete your data anytime by uninstalling the app</li>
                <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Your data is already on your device - no need to request it</li>
                <li><strong>No Consent Required:</strong> No data collection means no consent needed for data processing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Since ToothBrush AI doesn't collect any personal information from anyone, including children, there are no special considerations for children's privacy. The app can be safely used by users of all ages without any privacy concerns.</p>

            <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect, store, or transfer any user data, there are no international data transfers to consider. All your data remains on your local device regardless of your location.</p>

            <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>ToothBrush AI operates entirely offline and doesn't integrate with any third-party services, websites, or APIs. The app doesn't contain links to external services that could access your data.</p>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically.</p>
